You must register the vbBase Type library to run the "Complete" project.  There are many tools that have been created for this purpose, but the easiest way is to open up the "Complete" project group, and use the references to remove the "MISSING:" reference to the type library.  Then open the references dialog again and choose the "Browse" button.  Then navigate from the system directory to the directory that these files were extracted, and select the vbBase.tlb file.  This will automatically register and set a reference to this type library.

As a side note, you can apparently use the CoTaskMemFree function to free the PIDLs, but I've left the type library in because I still need it to get a PIDL from a path string.  If you know how to do this without the type lib, please let me know!
