This shows the bare minimum of code required (One module) to run these common dialogs.  The compiler switches in mCommonDialog.bas will ensure that the additional code for the other dialogs and the code for hooking the dialogs is not compiled into your executable.

The Print and Page Setup Dialogs require the cDeviceMode.cls file, and are not included in the minimum code examples.

The Folder dialog requires the vbBase.tlb file, and also is not included in the minimum code examples.
